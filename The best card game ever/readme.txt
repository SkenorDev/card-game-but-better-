Take some time to consider the actual process of working on this particular project.  Much learning happens in the process of looking back on things.  
Was it smooth or pretty rocky?  Why do you think that was? 

The Project was incredibly smooth, I was able to get a lot of the base mechanics from my redone solitare and already had a solid
grasp of how to store cards values and seperate them into tables. The most difficult areas for me were overall dealing with logic
of having 2 seperate sides and calling functions with cards. The start of solitare was really rocky with me as I was expecting
something like phaser where stuff like physics and clicking would be default functions but having to program everything from
scratch really caught me off guard. After the initial hurdle of working with solitare I've really enjoyed these projects. I 
really need to improve the organization of my functions.



How does this project compare to previous projects you've worked on.  Feel free to compare it to any other projects you've worked on for any other class or in any other context (ie. passion project, game jam, prior work experience, internship, etc.) 

Overall I usually have stayed in the scope of my knowledge in my projects so Ive never been too crazy challenged. Ive really enjoyed lua more than javascript as I feel like this this language allows
me to do so much crazy stuff 

What was the biggest triumph or thing you're proud of on this project?
Im really proud of the added "animations" where it shows the cards getting revealed in order, I havent dealt much with the update loop logic in the past
so I had to challenge myself to get this working when i did not properly set myself up to do so.


What was the biggest annoyance, problem, failure, or area for future improvement?
Overall I think the way I handled creating the cards functions and how I call them is not scalable and if I were to start from scratch I would personally entirely redo
the system and make it so the game state feed the cards functions and they react accordlingly. 



Would you want to work on something like this again?  Why or why not?
While I do frequently lose motivation I want to try making a card roguelike in lua. This is the first language I feel incredibly comfortable with as 
just using tables makes me feel ironically a lot less constrained. I think lua is a great language and I will most likely work on some passion projects
in it when I get some free time



Feel free to include any other insights, revelation, funny bug stories, or anything else you feel is relevant to what you learned from this project.

These projects have been honestly the most satisfying experience Ive ever had coding, these projects have constantly been challenging but never felt 
overencumbing. This has taught me a lot about how I can make coding more enjoyable, my strengths and weaknesses.
For instance these projects showed me how I stay motivated with large projects, often I find myself getting burnt out but this is often caused
by a lack of difficulty. I dont like coding stuff im comfortable with as I see it as busy work. When I'm not confident somethings gonna work, thats when im at my best.
The only bug that was a bit dumb was the card that adds +2 power for each ally on the board counted itself so the card was absolutely broken.
Trying to add animations created numerious bugs with the logic (such as being able to play cards for next turn while animations going).
